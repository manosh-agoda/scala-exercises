1. Use a trait to define a generic queue of strings with 'put' and 'get' methods, and create a class that implements it using an array. Include tests.
2. Starting from the previous exercise, use a stackable trait to modify the behavior of 'put' so it reverses each string (e.g. hello to olleh) before adding it to the queue. Include tests.
